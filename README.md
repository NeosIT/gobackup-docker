# gobackup for Kubernetes
This repository wraps [gobackup](https://github.com/huacnlee/gobackup) (and [dreitier's gobackup flavour](https://github.com/dreitier/gobackup)) and [interpolator](https://github.com/dreitier/interpolator) in a single, usable Docker image. 

## Description
[gobackup](https://github.com/huacnlee/gobackup) s a tool to dump databases and create backups of folders. It has various storage targets like `local`, `scp` and `S3`. Unfortunately, the current repository provides only the binary without any additional dependencies. You can easily deploy this Docker image into your Kubernetes cluster to create automatic backups.

## Getting started
- Mount the gobackup configuration file to `/etc/gobackup/config-raw.yaml`
- Placeholders in the configuration file like `${VAR}` are replaced by corresponding environment variables
- The resulting file is copied to `/etc/gobackup/gobackup.yaml`
- When **no arguments** are passed to the container, a simple `gobackup perform` is executed and the container exits.
- When periodic backups are desired, the container must be launched with the arguments `_cron ${cronExpression}` like so.

### Usage examples
Single backup:
```bash
docker run -v /path/to/my-gobackup-config.yaml:/etc/gobackup/config-raw.yaml dreitier/gobackup
``` 

Periodic backup every day at midnight:
```bash
docker run -v /path/to/my-gobackup-config.yaml:/etc/gobackup/config-raw.yaml dreitier/gobackup cron "0 0 * * *"
```

## Development
### Creating new releases
GitHub lacks the feature that repositories can easily subscribe to newer builds from upstream repository. Because of this, at the moment you have to manually push a tag to create a new gobackup release.

When creating a tag, use the tag format `${TAG}(-${GOBACKUP_GITHUB_REPOSITORY:huacnlee})?`. The first part before the `-` is the artifact, provided in the `${GOBACKUP_GITHUB_REPOSITORY}`. `${GOBACKUP_GITHUB_REPOSITORY}` is set to `huacnlee` by default.

#### Create a release based upon huacnlee's repository
```bash
docker tag v1.0.1
docker push v1.0.1 origin
```

#### Create a release based upon dreitier's repository
```bash
docker tag 20220722-dreitier
docker push 20220722-dreitier

# OR

docker tag v1.0.1_custom_pr-dreitier
docker push v1.0.1_custom_pr-dreitier origin
```

## Changelog
